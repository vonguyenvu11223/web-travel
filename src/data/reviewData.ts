                "The journey on the Lotus Train was characterized by a clean cabin and commendable service from the crew. The provision of hot and cold water for free was a valuable amenity. Our experience with VN Railway was smoother. Therefore, while the Lotus Train is appreciated for its cleanliness and service, improvements in the operation of the train could significantly enhance the overall experience.",
